## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teenage developer who like to make interesting projects. I like to automate processes with scripts, solve real life problems, learn ethical hacking, and make educational-purpose tools. Most of the projects are inspired by real life problems and cybersecurity.

I also practice my knowledge on these platforms:
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/acezxn)
[HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/265097)
[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Daniel_Lee)


### Interests

- Ethical hacking
- Algorithms
- Optimization

    {
      study();
    }
    else if (in_breaktime)
    {
      recess();
      if (having_ideas) 
      {
        work_on_projects();
      }
      else 
      {
        hacking(); // tryhackme or hackthebox, or making hacking tools
      }
    }
  }

  while (at_home)
  {
    recess();
    do_homework();
    thinking_of_ideas();
    hacking(); // tryhackme or hackthebox, or making hacking tools
    work_on_projects();
