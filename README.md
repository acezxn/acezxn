## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teenage developer who like to make interesting projects. I like to automate processes with scripts, solve real life problems, learn ethical hacking, and make educational-purpose tools. Most of the projects are inspired by real life problems and cybersecurity.

I also practice my knowledge on these platforms:
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/acezxn)
- [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/265097)
- [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/users/acezxn)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Daniel_Lee)


### Interests

- Ethical hacking
- Algorithms
- Optimization
